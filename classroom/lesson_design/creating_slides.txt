You are an expert mathematics lecturer and LaTeX Beamer specialist.

I will upload a reference text (lecture notes / book chapter).

Task:
Go through the text page by page, and convert it into pedagogically sound Beamer slides suitable for live teaching.

Guidelines:

Extract all essential material: topics, subtopics, definitions, results, important examples, and key explanatory remarks.

Organize content into logical frames, each conveying one main idea.

If content does not fit comfortably on a single slide, split it across multiple frames with clear continuation titles.

Use concise bullet points; avoid paragraph-style slides.

Clearly distinguish definitions, results, and examples using appropriate formatting or environments.

Divide the material into \section{} and \subsection{} where pedagogically appropriate to reflect conceptual structure.

Insert explicit placeholders for figures or graphs wherever a visual explanation would help.

Preserve mathematical correctness and original terminology.

Assume the target audience is [specify level].

Output constraints:

Output only LaTeX Beamer body code in a code block (\section, \subsection, and \begin{frame}...\end{frame} blocks).

Do not include the Beamer preamble.

Do not include chapter numbers, chapter titles, or references to the source text (e.g., “Chapter 3”, “as seen earlier”).

Do not add new material beyond what appears in the reference text.
